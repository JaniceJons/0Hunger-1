Our Idea

189.2 million people are undernourished in India. At the same time, it is estimated that nearly one-third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year gets lost or wasted. At 0hunger: where excess meets empty, we solve both the major problems like food shortage and food wastage. 

How does it work at 0hunger ?

The excess food from parties or wedding functions are always a headache and complete loss for the restaurants and hence instead of worrying about the food excess disposal, we offer to transfer the food in steel containers which shall be distributed for the needy. In return, the restaurants will be receiving a badge of recognition for working with us and helping for a social cause. 

Our end users are divided into two. Food excess from restaurants and hotels, which is of a little amount compared to the food excess from weddings and events will be sold as food packets to daily wage workers and migrant workers at a low price. Also, the excess food of large amounts will be served to the feasible slum spots for free. 

With good revenue, we are also planning to eradicate the wastage of imperfect food, that is nutrient-rich food items like vegetables and fruits which does not please the aesthetics of supermarkets by buying those and serving it to the poor for free. 

Details and specifications about the food including the expiry time of the food that is the best time before the food should be served, ingredients that can cause allergies, etc. will be uploaded by the restaurants on our website.

Slum locations or the feasible hunger spots where the food is to be served are found considering criteria like expiry time, distance from the event place, food insecurity rate, etc. 

A vehicle, a driver, a food tester and a helper will be allocated within a specified time whose location and other details can be viewed by the restaurants and website admin for complete transparency. 

The containers or food packets will be transported to the specified location within the specified time where the food will be distributed in their plates or organic plates made by our organisation or the packet as such.

The food will be distributed to people in slums/homeless peoples/migrant workers with food insecurity, thus making excess meet empty so that many more smiles are spread and many more stomachs are filled.

What about the food which cannot be consumed? Don't worry, we have got it covered. From biofuels to liquid fertilizer, many useful products can be manufactured from certain kinds of waste foods. Biofuels will be provided to poor households and manure will be given for the farmers. 


Conclusion

There's this quote from The Platform, A Netflix Series, “if everyone only ate what they needed, the food would reach the lowest levels”. This is what we are doing at 0Hunger. 0Hunger is our solution where excess meets empty. Along with providing awareness and methods to help, we are creating an online platform with infinite scalability with technology and kindness of our hearts.
